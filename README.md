# Laboratory C: An online chatroom (like Discord)

This is the companion code and exercises of the Chapter 12: Network Programming in Java.

### Usage

* `mvn compile` to compile both the server and client.
* `mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="lab.chatroom.Server" -q` to run the server (must be run before the client).
* `mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="lab.chatroom.Client" -q` to run a client (repeat this command to launch as many clients as you want).
